Look what we found, Karma reached out
Into our hearts and pulled us to our feet now
You know, the truth is we could disappear
Anywhere, as long as I got you there
When the sun dies, till the day shines
When I'm with you, there's not enough time
You are my spring flower, watching you bloom, wow
We are surrounded, but I can only see
